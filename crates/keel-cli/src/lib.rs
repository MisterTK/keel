//! `keel` — the command-line face of the product (dx-spec §1–2, §5–6).
//!
//! Subcommands: [`run`] (dispatch a script into a language front end),
//! [`init`] (evidence-merged policy generation), [`doctor`] (the honesty
//! report; `--effective-policy` prints the composed `defaults < packs < user`
//! policy via [`effective`]), [`status`] (the "what is Keel doing for me" screen),
//! [`explain`] (the frozen error taxonomy), the Tier 2 flow inspectors
//! [`flows`] (list durable flows), [`flows::trace`] (`keel trace`), and
//! [`replay`] (`keel replay` — a journal-driven dry run of what a re-entry
//! would substitute vs. re-execute), and [`mcp`] (`keel mcp`: the CLI doubles
//! as an MCP server over stdio whose six tools return the same bytes as the
//! corresponding `--json` twins).
//!
//! Every command obeys the DX invariants: a `--json` twin with byte-deterministic
//! output (sorted keys, no wall-clock timestamps), and stable exit codes —
//! [`EXIT_OK`], [`EXIT_FAILURE`], [`EXIT_USAGE`]. The command modules are the
//! testable core; [`main`](../keel/index.html) is a thin clap front.
